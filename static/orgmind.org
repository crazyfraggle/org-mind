#+TITLE: Org-mode mind

Since org-mode files are hierarchical, we can use them as a mind map.

* Learnings
What did you learn in school today?
** vitest
Snappy and easy to use.
Github Co-pilot happily created actual usable tests.
** Browser filesystem API
This is a thing. It's not well supported yet, but it's a thing.
https://developer.chrome.com/articles/file-system-access/
It will allow saving of the file when we get support for editting.
** CSS tricks
*** Variables
Allows passing CSS props from top level containers into child components without the need for prop drilling.
*** Container testing
This allowed me to pass whether we were left or right of the root node, and thus reverse the flex direction.
This is done using CSS variables and container style testing:
#+BEGIN_SRC scss
/* In top mindmap component */
#left {
    --rol: left;
}
#right {
    --rol: right;
}

/* In topic and suptopic components */
@container style(--rol: left) {
    .topic {
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
    }
}

@container style(--rol: right) {
    .topic {
        flex-direction: row;
    }
}
#+END_SRC

*** Mirroring using transform: scale
Used with container testing for right/left container, I could mirror the line drawing canvases (canvii?) using
#+BEGIN_SRC css
/* In the expander component */
@container style(--rol: left) {
    canvas {
        transform: scale(-1, 1);
    }
}
#+END_SRC
** ResizeObserver Web API
The ResizeObserver API was very useful for knowing when the node pointing lines needed redrawing.
** Svelte
Done Svelte before. This time I started with a more modern SvelteKit starting template.
*** Svelte can use svelte:this for recursive components
This allowed subtopics to have more suptopics.
*** Svelte adapter for github pages
First time I actually attempt to publish a Svelte app. The adapter for Github pages works well enough.

** VSCode Org mode
It sux. Revert to Emacs.

* Todo
** Org file parsing
*** Table support
We need to support this:
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
*** Pre-formatted text
Some pre-formatted text:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** This is a headline that should be in the pre-formatted text.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** DONE Code blocks
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
const a = 1;
#+END_SRC

*** Links
[[https://www.google.com][Google]]

*** Images?
[[file:./images/2021-08-22-16-00-00.png]]

*** Lists

**** Unordered
- List item 1
- List item 2

+ List item 1
+ List item 2
  - Sub list item

**** Ordered
1. List item 1
2. [ ] List item 2
3. [X] Completed list item

*** DONE TODO header definition to highlight TODO words.
** App
*** DONE UI: Subtopic lines
*** TODO Keyboard navigation
We need to allow arrow-key navigation between elements. Pressing right in an expandable node on the right should expand it, left the same on the left side. Tab should also expand if collapsed.
*** TODO Hide completed items
Need an option to display/hide these
*** TODO Double-tap to drill down (make tapped item root)
*** TODO UI: Settings in a popup
*** TODO File reload button
*** TODO Make Breadcrumb not suck
*** TODO Editting support.
For now, this is limited to viewing.
*** TODO Dark mode
*** TODO Less straight root topic lines
** Github
*** TODO Set up automatic build of github page on pushes to main
*** TODO Create a favicon
