#+TITLE: Org Mind

A mindmap viewer for org-mode files.

* Why?
For a long time, I've been organizing my brain in org-mode files. The hierarchical layout does fit into something that could work as a mindmap. So I wanted to check if this could be done.

* Usage
** Online
Launch the web page: TBD

** Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install and run project.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
#+END_SRC

* Requirements
Some fairly new (as of <2023-09-15 Fri>) CSS techniques have been used, so if it looks wrong, you probably need a more recent chromium based browser.
