Since org-mode files are hierarchical, we can use them as a mind map.

* Learnings
** [X] Can Svelte be an electron app?
It doesn't need to be. We can use the Filesystem Web API. :D
** [X] Vitest is great at testing.
** Svelte is great at building.
** Co-pilot is great at writing code.
** Co-pilot like to brag about itself.
** Co-pilot is awesome at writing tests.
** CSS Container queries
** Browser filesystem API
This is a thing. It's not well supported yet, but it's a thing.

* New things tested out
** vitest
Snappy and easy to use.
Co-pilot happily created actual usable tests.

** CSS things
*** Variables
Allows passing CSS props from top level containers into child components without the need for prop drilling.
*** Container testing
This allowed me to pass whether we were left or right of the root node, and thus reverse the flex direction.

** Svelte
Done that before. Just needs pointing out.
*** Svelte:this for recursive components

** VSCode Org mode
It sux. Revert to Emacs.

* Todo
** Org file parsing
*** Table support
We need to support this:
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
*** Pre-formatted text
Some pre-formatted text:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** This is a headline
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Code blocks
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
const a = 1;
#+END_SRC

*** Links
[[https://www.google.com][Google]]

*** Images?

*** Lists

**** Unordered
- List item 1
- List item 2

+ List item 1
+ List item 2
  - Sub list item

**** Ordered
1. List item 1
2. [ ] List item 2
3. [X] Completed list item

*** TODO header definition to highlight TODO words.
** App
*** TODO UI: Subtopic lines
*** TODO Keyboard navigation
We need to allow arrow-key navigation between elements. Pressing right in an expandable node on the right should expand it, left the same on the left side. Tab should also expand if collapsed.
*** TODO Editting support.
For now, this is limited to viewing.

*** TODO Hide completed items
*** TODO Double-tap to drill down (make tapped item root)
